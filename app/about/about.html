    <p>In my free time, I enjoy paddle boarding, kayaking, hiking, spin cycling, yoga, bridge, games, reading and walking and talking with family and friends.
    </p>
    <p>I am the Care Coordinator and a Care Counselor at Mariner’s church.  I absolutely love it.  I am always amazed at the difference I see in people lives.  It’s so wonderful to see women become the person God designed them to be.
