  <h3>Benefits of Life Coaching</h3>

  <div>

    <p>Everyone Needs a Life Coach</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You want to do better</li>
      <li>You want to feel better</li>
      <li>You want to get results</li>
      <li>You want to be more confident</li>
      <li>You want to have a joyful, fulfilling and meaningful life</li>
    </ul>



    <p>How does coaching make this happen?</p>

    <p>First, it increases awareness.  We take time to look at your life from the outside</p>
    <p>Second, it gets emotions and unhealthy beliefs about yourself under control.  Emotional management is imperative to make progress</p>
    <p>Finally, it demands ACTION.  I insist on making commitments and following through for predictable results.</p>
    <p>Coaching is starting where you are and moving forward.</p>
