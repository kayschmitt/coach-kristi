  <h3>What is Life Coaching?</h3>

  <div>

    <p>Life Coaching is a powerful and dynamic partnership between coach and client that focuses on who you can be, what you want to create in your life, and support to help you make meaningful changes.  Coaching helps remind you that you are the leader in your life.  It takes courage, guidance and intention to live a fulfilled life.
    </p>
    <p>Your life may be missing something:  time for yourself, peace, fulfillment, balance or passion.  Or you may have too much of something else: stress, loss, procrastination, confusion, financial pressure etc.  Whatever your life needs, I can offer passionate and personalized support as you work to connect to who you truly are and create the life you always imagined.
    </p>
    <p>Life Coaching is designed to encourage those who feel their lives are in transition; those who are feeling stuck, frustrated and discontent, but know they are capable of so much more.  Those who want to know how to trust themselves and master the art of living their dream life.
