  <h3>Intuitive Eating Coaching</h3>

  <div>
    <h4>Intuitive eating coaching is for you if:</h4>
    <ul>

      <li>You want to eat in a way that makes your body feel good without trying so hard</li>
      <li>You’re done with diets and “non-diets” but know you still need to do something </li>
      <li>You feel lost trying to figure out how to eat “healthy”</li>
      <li>You’re ready to change but you need some support</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h4>As an intuitive eater you will:</h4>
    <ul>

      <li>Tune into your hunger and fullness signals</li>
      <li>Eat any and all foods that appeal to you, without worry of overeating</li>
      <li>Know ways of dealing with emotions without food</li>
      <li>Trust your inner wisdom to tell you what, when, and how to eat</li>
      <li>Eat for satisfaction, nourishment, and pleasure</li>
      <li>Love, respect, and care for your amazing body- unconditionally!</li>

    </ul>

    Becoming an intuitive eater is a process, not a quick fix.
    <i>This is what makes it so different from dieting.</i>
    Dieting is about trying to adopt rules that don’t really fit who you are or what you need.
    <b>Intuitive eating is about reconnecting with your deepest wisdom about that which truly nourishes you.</b>
