  <h3>What is Melt?</h3>

  <p>The MELT Method® (MELT®) is a simple self-treatment technique that reduces chronic pain and helps you stay healthy,
    youthful, and active for a lifetime. Just 10 minutes of MELT three times a week is all you need to reduce the
    effects of accumulated tension and stress caused by daily living.
    New research has revealed the missing link to pain-free living: a balanced nervous system and healthy connective
    tissue. These two components work together to provide your body support and optimal mind-body communication.
    MELT directly addresses these two systems of your body in a way no other self-treatment can, including diet and
    exercise. You'll see and feel results in the first session. Over time MELT heightens your body’s ability to repair
    and heal itself, which can create remarkable, lasting changes. MELT offers natural pain relief, addressing the true
    cause of pain, not just the symptoms.
    MELT was created by New York City manual therapist and connective tissue specialist Sue Hitzmann. Using specialized
    techniques, a soft body roller, and four different small balls, MELT rehydrates the connective tissue, rebalances
    the nervous system, and restores space to compressed joints.

    In her New York Times bestselling book The MELT Method, currently published in eight languages, Hitzmann has brought
    this easy self-treatment to more than 200,000 people around the world – and now it’s your turn.
    MELT is for anyone who wants to slow down the aging process and live pain-free. For those in their 40s, 50s, 60s,
    and older who want to stay active, mobile, and independent – MELT is a must. MELT is also for active younger adults
    and athletes who want to maintain a fit, healthy body and achieve optimal performance without debilitating wear and
    tear.
    Even if you are pregnant, injured, post-surgery, overweight, sedentary, out of shape or have limited mobility,
    chronic pain, knee or hip replacements, or bone disorders – you can still MELT. It’s the best starting point for any
    exercise and wellness program. People who MELT regularly find that they want to exercise more often. It’s just more
    fun to move when your body feels good, has more energy, and is free of pain.
    MELT is easy to learn and offers results the first time you try it. MELT can help you fall asleep more easily and
    sleep more soundly, have more energy during the day, improve your posture, reduce stress and tension, shed excess
    body fat, and even reduce cellulite. Best of all, your body feels great long after you MELT! The results that MELT
    provides were previously available only through ongoing, costly hands-on therapies. Now you can be your own
    Hands-off Bodyworker® and be in control of your health.
    A little proactive self-care goes a long way toward keeping you pain-free and active for a lifetime.
    – Sue Hitzmann

  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <div>
    <p>Kristi recently completed the second training series in the MELT Method under founder Sue Hitzmann and is now a
      certified Length and Hand and Foot MELT instructor.  She is excited to help others learn how MELT can enhance
      their performance and maintain a pain-free functional body throughout their lifetime.</p>

    <p>Kristi has always led an active lifestyle.  She played varsity tennis, field hockey and badminton for four years
      in
      high school and enjoyed running and aerobics in college.  After college, she continued to run and participated in
      numerous triathlons.  Unfortunately, she was forced to cut back on her physical activities due to chronic pain in
      her shoulders, low back, hips and knees.  She also experienced chronic headaches and anxiety which resulted in
      sleepless nights and a lack of focus and energy.  She spent thousands of dollars seeking relief from countless
      doctors, specialists, pain clinics, body workers, and therapies.  </p>

    <p>Kristi stumbled upon the MELT Method and after just a few classes began to notice a decrease in her chronic pain
      and
      body aches.  She also felt more peaceful, relaxed and focused and started sleeping more soundly.  She also found
      that she was able to run without pain.  This gave her hope that she could continue to be active, pain-free and
      full
      of energy for the rest of her life.  </p>

    <p>Kristi is excited to introduce MELT to others and to show them how they can improve how their bodies feel and
      function.</p>
