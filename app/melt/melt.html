  <h3>What is Melt?</h3>

    <p>The MELT Method® (MELT®) is a simple self-treatment technique that reduces chronic pain and helps you stay
      healthy, youthful, and active for a lifetime. 
    </p>

    <p>MELT is easy to learn and offers results after the first session. Using specialized techniques, a soft body
      roller, and small soft balls, MELT rehydrates the connective tissue and rebalances the nervous system. These two
      components work together to provide your body support and optimal mind-body communication. MELT directly addresses
      these two systems of your body in a way no other self-treatment can. Over time MELT heightens your body’s ability
      to repair and heal itself, which can create remarkable, lasting changes. 
    </p>
    <p>I can teach you how to MELT at home on your own in less than ten private sessions. Just 10 minutes of MELT three
      times a week is all you need to get rid of that stiffness, aches and pains, help you sleep better and increase
      your energy. It’s an enjoyable and soothing technique that can keep you active and pain free for a lifetime.
